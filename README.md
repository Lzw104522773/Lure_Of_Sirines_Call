# The Lure of the Sirine's Call
Adds a quest - and pirates! - to the sirines and the southern part of the lighthouse map

A Questmod for Baldur's Gate (classic BG1:TotSC, Tutu (EasyTutu), BGT, BG:EE, and EET)!

The seeds of this mod were sown during a discussion on the merits of creating and publishing smaller mods as an attempt to fuel further interest in Tutu modding, and to increase the likelihood of updating and improving on said small mods. The premise is that once you have something released, people will find things that could be better, things that are wrong with it, and ways it could be expanded upon. The creator can build on that as time goes on.

The mod itself takes place in the coastal area south of Candlekeep, and involves the lighthouse, the treasure cavern, the sirines dwelling along the beach, and worgs. Also pirates. Everyone loves pirates. At the end of it all you should have either a warm fuzzy feeling in your heart, or a bunch of loot. This quest will especially appeal to druids, though any class can play it without missing any content, dialogue, or equipment.

Explore the southern part of the lighthouse map (AR3600.are) to start the quest.

The optional component "Extended Lighthouse Area" replaces the area with a version without stones in front of the lighthouse entrance and adds doors that actually open. This component is not compatible with Tutu. By White Agnus. 

Note: For downloading the current version from GitHub, make sure you go to the releases page and download the latest release of this mod!
