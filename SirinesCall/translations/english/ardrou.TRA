@0    = ~Brennan, are you okay?  Oh, thank you so much!  Here, this money is all my husband brought back from market this past week but take it.  My son's life is worth this and so much more.~


/* @1 and @2: no longer needed 
@1    = ~I feel ashamed to take it but Ardrouine has thrust her last 60 gold pieces into my hands. At least her son is safe, though nightmares will surely keep him from that old abandoned lighthouse for years to come. Alas but there flees a child's innocence, shamed and broken by the Dark.~
@2    = ~I cannot write long as I am faced with a pressing emergency: Worgs have surrounded an abandoned lighthouse to the west and poor Ardrouine's son is trapped within. ...May Tymora bless the peasants of this land for their lives are never easy.~
