# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = The mod itself takes place in the coastal area south of Candlekeep, and involves the lighthouse, the treasure cavern, the sirines dwelling along the beach, and worgs. Also pirates. Everyone loves pirates. At the end of it all you should have either a warm fuzzy feeling in your heart, or a bunch of loot. This quest will especially appeal to druids, though any class can play it without missing any content, dialogue, or equipment.
Explore the southern part of the lighthouse map to start the quest.

The second, optional component "Extended Lighthouse Area" replaces the area with a version without stones in front of the lighthouse entrance and adds doors that actually open. This component is not compatible with Tutu. By White Agnus.
